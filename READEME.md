### Description
This project is about building a web application like Netflix using React JS. 

I used followings for the project:
- **Firebase Authentication**: this was used for user authentication with email and password
- **TMDB API**: this was used to get movie data such as title and image.

**How the website works**
1. Index page will show up first.
2. Click sign in button to sign in.
3. If you have an account, simply login, otherwise sign up with an email and password.
4. When signed in, main page will be loaded with movie data and categories.

**Responsive?**

This app is responsive in smaller window size, but not mobile.
